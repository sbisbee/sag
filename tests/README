Sag Tests
=========

These would be unit tests if they didn't rely on the database - think of them
as a cross between integration and unit tests. They are written with PHPUnit
(http://www.phpunit.de/) and are known to run with version 3.3.16, though other
versions will probably work too.

The coverage directory contains code base coverage reports generated by PHPUnit
and Xdebug.

Running the Tests
-----------------

It is highly recommended that you run `make check` from the parrent directory
(project/git root) instead of doing it manually.

Running the Tests - Manually
----------------------------

Make sure your present working directory is the tests directory (where you
found this file) and that the Sag src directory is above it (../src/).

You should always run `./bootstrap.php` first, as it will check to make sure
you have all the required binaries, that the test database doesn't already
exist, and that your user permissions are correct.

`phpunit .` will simply run all the tests

`phpunit --coverage-html=./coverage/ .` will run all the tests and re-generate
the coverage reports
