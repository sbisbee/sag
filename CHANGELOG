Sag Changes
===========

Version 0.5.0
-------------

Breaking Changes

  * These functions now return the current instance of Sag ($this):
    decode, setDatabase, setOpenTimeout, setRWTimeout, setCache,
    setStaleDefault. This allows configuration functions to be chained before
    you make a call to CouchDB. (closes #14)

New Features

  * We now support connection pooling for sockets with HTTP's Connection:
    Keep-Alive. This means we no longer open and close a socket for each
    request made (better performance). No management is provided for the
    maximum number of sockets that can be kept open, since this should be done
    at the operating system level (ulimit or pam for Linux/Unix). (closes #15)

  * Added the examples/ directory with an example of how one could store PHP
    session data in CouchDB. Related blog post:
    http://weblog.bocoup.com/storing-php-sessions-in-couchdb

  * Added tests/bootstrap.php to make running the tests easier.

Fixed Bugs

  * All query parameters are now properly URL encoded. However, developers must
    do their own URL encoding for get($url) URLs, etc., which is now noted in
    the documentation.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

New Features

  * When initiated, Sag checks the PHP environment for unsupported
    error_reporting values. Thanks to Simeon Willbanks. (closes #8, #9)

Fixed Bugs

  * Fixed a bug where an invalid Content-Size was being sent even if no data
    was passed to the packet.
  * Fixed a bug in POST where an incorrect variable name was being used,
    allowing improper paths to be sent to CouchDB.

  * When caching, bulk() now iterates over the documents it's trying to update
    and sends them to the cache. If a document's _deleted property is true,
    then it's removed from the cache.

Version 0.3
-----------

New Features

  * Cookie based authentication. Thanks to Benjamin Young. (closes #1)
  * Cache results with the SagCache interface. Currently supports caching to
    disk with SagFileCache.
  * Support for HEAD requests. Thanks to Doug Cone. (closes #3)
  * You can now POST to any URI in the database, adding a second $uri parameter
    to the post() function. Allows POST'ing to views. Thanks to Peter Kruithof.
    (closes #7)
  * Exposing CouchDB's runtime _stats interface with the getStats() function.

Fixed Bugs

  * getAllDocs() no longer always includes documents. Thanks to
    www.github.com/hepp.

Version 0.2
-----------

  * Officially adding support for 1.0.x and dropping support for 0.10.x.

New Features

  * Native support for attachments.
  * Internal support for different Content-Type values.
  * Can set timeout on socket connection.
  * Can set timeout on socket read/write.

Fixed Bugs

  * Removed leading white space in header values.
  * Fixed ending line breaks when sending data via a PUT.
