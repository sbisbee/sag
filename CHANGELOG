Sag Changes
===========

Version 0.5.0
-------------

Breaking Changes

  * These functions now return the current instance of Sag ($this):
    decode, setDatabase, setOpenTimeout, setRWTimeout, setCache,
    setStaleDefault. This allows configuration functions to be chained before
    you make a call to CouchDB. (closes #14)

New Features

  * Added the examples/ directory with an example of how one could store PHP
    session data in CouchDB. Related blog post:
    http://weblog.bocoup.com/storing-php-sessions-in-couchdb

Fixed Bugs

  * All query parameters are now properly URL encoded. However, developers must
    do their own URL encoding for get($url) URLs, etc., which is now noted in
    the documentation.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

New Features

  * When initiated, Sag checks the PHP environment for unsupported
    error_reporting values. Thanks to Simeon Willbanks. (closes #8, #9)

  * setStaleDefault() was created to easily allow developers the choice of
    making all of their GET and HEAD requests use stale=ok or not. This is
    great for production systems that do all their querying against stale
    views, allowing another process to trigger index updates based on the
    _changes feed.

  * Now when calling setDatabase() you can tell it to create the database if it
    does not exist (uses an HTTP GET to check if it exists). If the database
    does not exist, then createDatabase() is called to create it.

Fixed Bugs

  * Fixed a bug where an invalid Content-Size was being sent even if no data
    was passed to the packet.

  * Fixed a bug in POST where an incorrect variable name was being used,
    allowing improper paths to be sent to CouchDB.

  * When caching, bulk() now iterates over the documents it's trying to update
    and sends them to the cache. If a document's _deleted property is true,
    then it's removed from the cache.

Version 0.3
-----------

New Features

  * Cookie based authentication. Thanks to Benjamin Young. (closes #1)

  * Cache results with the SagCache interface. Currently supports caching to
    disk with SagFileCache.

  * Support for HEAD requests. Thanks to Doug Cone. (closes #3)

  * You can now POST to any URI in the database, adding a second $uri parameter
    to the post() function. Allows POST'ing to views. Thanks to Peter Kruithof.
    (closes #7)

  * Exposing CouchDB's runtime _stats interface with the getStats() function.

Fixed Bugs

  * getAllDocs() no longer always includes documents. Thanks to
    www.github.com/hepp.

Version 0.2
-----------

  * Officially adding support for 1.0.x and dropping support for 0.10.x.

New Features

  * Native support for attachments.
  * Internal support for different Content-Type values.
  * Can set timeout on socket connection.
  * Can set timeout on socket read/write.

Fixed Bugs

  * Removed leading white space in header values.
  * Fixed ending line breaks when sending data via a PUT.
